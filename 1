     \textbf{2.} If China’s state owned commercial banks seem
burdened by bad debts, the Country’s rural financial
sector is even worse. In the villages, the only formal
banking institutions are what are known as rural credit
co-operatives. These (11)the distinction in China of
having been officially declared insolvent. The rural
credit co-operatives are ill named. They are often
reluctant to(12) and they are not run as co-operatives
as they do not (13) any profits and their customers
have no say in their operations. Until 1996,they were
offshoots of the Agricultural Bank of China. Since
then they have been (14) by the Central Bank, though
they are in reality run by country government. Even
the word ‘rural’ is misleading. (15)of their deposits are
sucked up and put in the urban banking system.
Farmers usually find it easier to (16) from friends or

relatives or black market moneylenders. Yet the co-
operatives remain a big part of China’s financial

system. Last year, they (17) for 12 percent of deposits
and 11 percent of loans. In recent years, commercial
banks (including the Agricultural bank) have closed
down (18) in the countryside. Yet some 40,000 credit
co-operatives remain in place with one in almost every
township as the larger villages or smaller rural towns

are (19). If as the government claims, the credit co-
operatives are beginning to turn a profit after six years

of losses, it is not because they are any better run. In an
effort to (20) a stagnant rural economy, the central
bank has pumped more than \$9 billion into them
hoping that they will lend more to farmers. But the
root causes of their problems remain and the real
solution may have to involve a mix of approaches from
commercial banking to real cooperatives.\\\\

    \section{Abbreviations}
      Abbreviations are shortened forms of words or phrases. They are created by taking the initial letters or syllables of a phrase and condensing it into a shorter form, usually preserving the main components of the original term. Abbreviations are commonly used to save space, time, or effort in writing or speech.\\\\

    \section{F.R.I.E.N.D.S?}
      A video of the TV show \textbf{F.R.I.E.N.D.S} was opened on \href{https://youtube.com}{Youtube}\\
      It is the scene of joey writing letter of recomendation for \textbf{Monica and Chandler} who want to adopt a baby. He starts off childish, then gets help with ross. What happens next is shocking!!!\\\\
      
    \section{Aftermath}
      New Topic of spelling error correction started. Mistakes have been highlighted in bold. \\\\
      Recently, researchers who study chimpanzees have come to the \textbf{suprising} conclusion that groups of chimpanzees have
their own traditions that can be \textbf{past} on to new generations of chimps. The chimps do not \textbf{aquire} these traditions by
instinct; instead, they learn them from other chimps. When a scientific journal published \textbf{analysises} of chimpanzee
behavior, the author revealed that the every day actions of chimpanzees in \textbf{seperate} areas differ in significant ways, even
when the groups belong to the same subspecies. For instance, in one West African group, the chimps are often seen \textbf{puting}
a nut on a stone and using another \textbf{peice} of stone to crack the nut open, a kind of behavior never observed in other groups
of chimpanzees. \textbf{Sceintists} have also observed the chimps teaching \textbf{there} young the nut opening method, and chimps in
other places that crack nuts \textbf{differentally} teach their young \textbf{they’re} own way. Researchers have \textbf{therefor} concluded that
chimpanzees have local traditions.\\
Frans de Waal, who has been \textbf{studing} primates, wrote a book \textbf{makeing} the \textbf{arguement} that these learned behaviors
should be considered kinds of culture. The word culture has \textbf{traditionly} been used to describe human \textbf{behavier}, but may be,
he says, a new definition is needed. Considering this \textbf{startlingly-new} theory of chimpanzee “culture,” some researchers
think that humans now have an \textbf{un-deniable} obligation to protect the lives of all remaining wild chimpanzees rather than
\textbf{zeroeing} in on just a few of the \textbf{threatenned} animals. The \textbf{lost} of a single group of wild chimpanzees would, they say,
destroy something irreplacable, a unique culture with its own traditions and way of life.\\
